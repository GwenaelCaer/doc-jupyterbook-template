# Introduction

This presentation focuses on two key aspects:

1. **Publication** — using GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD to automatically build and publish your documents.  
2. **Interactivity** — enabling in-page execution for quick tests and running code in JupyterLab for a full interactive experience.
